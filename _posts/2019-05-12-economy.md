*It's been a while since the last blog we posted and that's because we have been working very hard and simply didn't find a time to write posts. The reason we have been working so hard is that the first public pre-alpha is very close and we are making sure everything is ready. So we we thought we would walk you through the different core features of the game so you are ready when it launches. And that's what we will be doing in the upcoming blog posts, first off we will be looking at the whole economy system which has undergone quite big changes since we last mentioned it.*

Your primary source of money will be so called demands, you can think of them as stores, they appear in towns and will give you money in exchange for goods. And if you provide enough goods to satify their requirments they will slowly "level up" and their requirment amounts will increase as they do, these upgrades are also influenced by town size with each upgrade requiring hiegher population.
On the other hand, when you do not provide the goods, those levels will decay until it goes bankrupt.

There is a catch though, and that is that you can't just pour all the goods you produce into a single demand. The reason being that demands operate under a simplified supply and demand model, so the more goods you deliver the less money they will give you for them, and at some point their storage will fill up and they won't accept them at all. These numbers are separate for each demand and you can find them in their respective overview windows.

So we have covered how you make money with demands, but they serve another important purpose and that's making town grow. How do they do that?

Quite simply actually, towns will grow a tiny bit faster for each demand that has it's requirements satisfied each month. But these requirements will increase over time, as described above, so it will take more and more effort to grow the town as it gets bigger. Another reason is that as the town grows, more demands will appear, more specifically demands from higher tiers. These want goods that are created using factories and also need to be researched beforehand, but in turn give you quite a bit more money.

Another big thing to note about them is that there is a limit of 2 demands of each tier per city. Which means that when you are producing more goods than a single demand desires, you will have to find another one of the same type in another town. This forces you to build out you network and focus on many different supply chains at once. So if you want to sell all 7 of the tier 2 materials, you will need 4 towns that grew to a size sufficient for tier 2 demands to appear.

Lastly we will touch a bit on modding related stuff. You can of course add your own custom demands, you can specify the material requested, the amounts of it, the price ranges, the buildings used for the demands, and basically everything else. You can also edit the base game demands if you want to.

Next time we will focus on the research system and everything it involves.
