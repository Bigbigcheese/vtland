In [0.79](/changelog#0.79) we have introduced C# mods support. Finally, enthusiasts who donâ€™t want to limit themselves to creating content-based mods may get their hands on tools allowing them to add new or modify existent logic and behaviors of Voxel Tycoon.

While modification of game code was already possible by patching game library files, this update introduces a streamlined way to pack your custom code into distributable mods.

The proper documentation of the APIs is still lacking, but **we highly encourage you to start bringing your ideas to life and give us feedback on what new APIs, hooks, events, and any other changes you need**.

Good luck, have fun!
