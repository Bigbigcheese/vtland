It was quite a lot of stuff happened from the last post. Here's quick recap of what's going on.

## Pre-alpha is real!

We've started rolling the very first wave of pre-alpha testing.

These are completely zero-tested builds of the game, filled with issues and very limited gamplay. Althought it's very important step for us as we started to receive actual real feedback. And it's actually very useful!

As a result, we have really lot to update, fix and improve. We push at least one new build almost every day to our testers.

This is really a lot of work we have to do now. But as we'll done with that, we are going to start the next wave of alpha tests. If you are interested in, stay tuned ‚Äî we'll announce it a bit later.

## Cargoes

In case you missed, we added a few new products (actually, over 20 üò±) to mine, transport, process, produce and sell in the first alpha.

The next thing we are satisfied with is the way of carrying cargos with vehicles and warehouses. Among other things, it's very easy now to add new cargoes as mods.

## Usability updates

To provide player-friendly experience we are started to add a lot of little things to help players, such as tooltips, hotkey hints, localization, and so on.

## Closer to final UI

We continue to apply the final look and feel to game windows.

Finally, save and load interface make its apperance to the game. Of course, we couldn't resist from adding little details like preview images for your saves:

And, of course, settings:

## In case you missed

Depots! Yes, we added them to the game, and even already had a chance to update the train one to make it a little bit longer üòâ

And one more pretty important thing: custom animations support for vehicles and buildings. Just look at this cutie üòç
