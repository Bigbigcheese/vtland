Hello fellow tycoons! The time for a new state-of-things report has come.

Do you remember that pretty unreadable changelog we shared a month ago in the [previous post]({% post_url 2020-12-28-oof %})? It summarizes all the changes from 0.84 (Itch version) to the point when closed beta started:

{% include img.html src="/assets/oof/changelog.png" %}

Since then, we've added a few more changes to it:

{% include img.html src="/assets/quick-dev-update/log.png" %}

As you can see, it's still unreadable (on purpose, as usual). However, there's one thing we can't hide from you:

{% include img.html src="/assets/quick-dev-update/steam_workshop.png" %}

Yep, we've reached a new milestone: Steam Workshop integration is fully completed! We can't wait to get you all on board so you can explore the community-made content in a convenient way, and even share your own creations with ease to a broader audience.

This also means that we have only one major task left before going to Steam EA - the tutorial. Of course, there's a bunch of fixes, tweaks, and balance tuning still required here and there, but we finally started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And that's good.

That's it for today. We'll keep you informed about how progress is going, and see you next time!
