## What it's all about?

Voxel Tycoon — tycoon strategy game about *transportation*, *building&nbsp;factories*, and *mining* beautiful voxel landscapes.

If you like games such as Transport Tycoon (OpenTTD) and Factorio, or playing modded Minecraft, you're in the right place.

## When will it be released?

If everything goes well, you can expect early alpha to be available at the end of *this year*.

There's no final release planned, as we committed to constantly update current version with new content and improvements.

If you can't follow our [social networks](/contacts) for some reason, but want to be sure not to miss the release of the game, you can subscribe to our [very-rare-newsletter]({{site.newsletter_url}}). No spam guarantee.

## How big maps can be? Is there terraforming?

The game world is infinite, so you never will run out of space. Furthermore, the world is not just a surface — you can explore, dig or even blow every voxel down to the bedrock. Or, conversely, form a mountain from them. So yes, we have full featured terraforming here.

## I saw you said Transport Tycoon. What features will railways have?

Everything you will expect from such games, including, but not limited to:

• Complex signaling and scheduling

• Variety of locomotives, each with different characteristics and visuals

• Different types of railcars for different types of cargo

• Electrified railways

• Different bridges and tunnels

...and more added later

• Manual train control and coupling for more fun!

• [Multi-track drifting]()
{% endcomment %}

## What if I mess with signaling, will my trains crash or just pass through each other?

Trains will brutally crash, resulting in financial and reputation losses.

By the way, remember the terraforming part? If your train has carried some dangerous cargo, you can end up with a few unwanted craters in your landscape (and say goodbye to buildings nearby).

## What trains will carry? I mean, what about goods/resources?

We have plenty of different resources on our maps — from wood and easily obtainable ores such as coal to much rarer ones hiding deep underground.

You can sell raw resources, but as cities grow, they will require goods crafted from different resources on complex factories which you should design and build.

## I saw decoupled railway cars in [Greenlight Trailer](https://youtu.be/u1kRZKu3NAc?t=51). Is there will be coupling in the game?

We definitely want to see railway coupling in the game, as well as shunting works, but we are still testing it for caveats.

## What about passenger transit?

You bet!

## What other types of transport will there be in the game, besides trains?

Trucks, ships, planes, with more to come later.

## Will modding of the game be supported?

Absolutely! We will provide some sort of early authoring tools soon.

## Is there going to be a multiplayer?

Yes, there will be co-op and versus multiplayer, added sometime after early alpha release.

## Is it pure sandbox or will it have some kind of quests or a campaign?

On launch, there will be sandbox mode only, with some random events maybe. We will make sure that you will not get bored.

## On what platform will it be released?

Thanks to the engine we chose (it's Unity), the game should run flawlessly on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. But we didn't test Linux builds yet,
so it's just in theory for now.

## What about consoles/mobile platforms?

Again, our engine supports a huge variety of platforms, but some of them require special treatment in terms of UI and hardware resource management, so - it's possible, but not on our roadmap at this moment.

## Who is in charge?

We are two developers with over 9 years of professional experience, very passionate about tycoons in particular and good games in common.
Also, we love stylish, beautiful things.

## How can I help?

First of all, do not hesitate to tell about Voxel Tycoon to every train-tycoon-Minecraft-voxel-lover you know. Also, since English is not our native language, you can help us proofread our materials (like this FAQ) and [report](/contacts) any mistakes.

For those who want to contribute to Voxel Tycoon, or prepare for modding the game before it will be released we will provide some sort of early authoring tools soon.

## I think you have done something wrong!

Feel free to express your criticism in [any convenient way](/contacts), but please keep in mind that everything you see is very far from finished experience. We'are constantly working and improving the game.
