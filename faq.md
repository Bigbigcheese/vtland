# What it's all about?

Voxel Tycoon — tycoon strategy game about *transportation*, *building&nbsp;factories*, and *mining* beautiful voxel landscapes.

If you like games such as Transport Tycoon (OpenTTD) and Factorio, or playing modded Minecraft, you're in the right place.

# When it will be released?

If everything goes well, you can expect early alpha to be available at the end of *this year*.

There's no final release planned, as we committed to constantly update current version with new content and improvements.

If you can't follow our [social networks](/contacts) for some reason, but want to be sure not to miss the release of the game, you can subscribe to our [very-rare-newsletter]({{site.newsletter_url}}). No spam guarantee.

# How big maps can be? Is there terraforming?

The game world is infinite, so you never will run out of space. Furthermore, the world is not just a surface — you can explore and dig (or blow) every voxel down to the bedrock. Or, form a mountain from them. So yes, we have full featured terraforming here.

# I saw you said Transport Tycoon. What features railways will have?

Everything you will expect from such games, including, but not limited to:

• Complex signaling and scheduling

• Variety of locomotives, each with different characteristics and visuals

• Different types of railcars for different types of cargo

• Electrified railways

• Different bridges and tunnels

• ...and more added later

• Manual train control and coupling for more fun!

• [Multi-track drifting]()

# What if I mess with signaling, will my trains broke? Or just pass through each other?

Yes, trains will collapse, resulting to financial and reputation losses.

By the way, remember the terraforming part? If your train has carried some dangerous cargo, you can end up with a few unwanted craters in your landscape (and say goodbye to buildings nearby).

# What trains will carry? I mean, what about goods/resources?

We have plenty of different resources on our maps — from wood and easily obtainable ores such as coal to much rarer ones hiding deep underground.

You can sell raw resources, but as cities grow, they will require goods crafted from different resources on complex factories which you should design and build.

# What about passanger transit?

You bet!

# What other types of transport will in the game, besides trains?

Trucks, ships, planes, with more to come later.

# Is this game will support modding?

Absolutely!

# Is there will be multiplayer?

Yes, there will be co-op and versus multiplayer, added some time after early alpha release.

# It's pure sandbox or it will have some kind of quests or campaign?

On launch, there will be sandbox mode only, with some random events maybe. We will make sure that you will not get bored.

# On what platform it will be released?

Thanks to the engine we chose (it's Unity), the game should run flawlessly on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. But we didn't test Linux builds yet,
so it's just in theory for now.

# What about consoles/mobile platforms?

Again, our engine supports a huge variety of platforms, but some of them require special treatment in terms of UI and hardware resource management, so - it's possible, but not on our roadmap at this moment.

# Who is in charge?

We are two developers with over 9 years of professional experience, very passionate about tycoons in particular and good games in common.
Also, we love stylish, beautiful things.

# I noticed you have done something wrong!

Feel free to express your criticism in [any convenient way](/contacts), but please keep in mind that everything you see is very far from finished experience. We'are constantly working and improving the game.

# How I can help?

First of all, do not hesitate to tell about Voxel Tycoon to any train-tycoon-minecraft-voxel-lover you know.

For those who want to contribute to Voxel Tycoon, or prepare for modding the game before it will be released we will provide some sort of early authoring tools soon. Follow the news!
