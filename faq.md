## What it's all about?

Voxel Tycoon — strategy game about **transportation**, **building&nbsp;factories**, and **mining** beautiful voxel landscapes.

If you like games such as Transport Tycoon (OpenTTD) and Factorio, or playing modded Minecraft, you're in the right place.

## When it will be released?

If everything goes well, you can expect early alpha to be available at the end of **this year**.

There's no *final* release planned, as we commited to constantly update current version with new content and improvements.

If you can't to follow our [social networks](/contacts) for some reason, but want to be sure not to miss release of the game, you can subscribe to our [very-rare-newsletter]({{site.newsletter_url}}).

## It's pure sandbox or it will have some kind of quests or campaing?

On launch only sandbox will be featured, with some random events maybe.

## How big maps can be? Is there terraforming?

The maps are infinite, so you never will run out of space. And not less important: the world is not just a surface — you can explore and dig (or blow) every voxel down to the bedrock. Or pour a hill. So yes, we have full featured terraforming here.

## What if I mess with signalling, will my trains broke? Or just pass through each other?

Yes, and remember the terraforming part? If your train has carried some dangerous cargo, you can end up with some unwantad caverns in your landscape (and say goodbye to buildings nearby).

## What other features railways will have?

* Variety of trains, each with different characteristics and visuals
* Different types of railcars for different types of cargo
* Eletrified railways
* Different kind of bridges
* Tunnels

* Manual train control and coupling for more fun!
* [Multi-track drifting]()

## What trains will carry? I mean, what about goods/resources?

We have plenty of different resouces on our maps — from forest and easy ores such as coal, to much more rare hidden deep undeground. You can sell raw resources, but as cities grow, they will require goods, crafted from different resources on complex factories which you will build.

## What other types of transport will in the game, besides trains?

Trucks, ships, planes, with more to come later.

## Is this game will support modding?

Absolutely!

## Is there will be multiplayer?

Yes, there will be co-op and versus miltiplayer, but some time later after early alpha release.

## On what platform it will be released?

Thank to engine we chose (it's Unity), game should flowlessly run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. But we don't tested Linux builds yeat,
so it's just in theory for now.

## What about consoles/mobile platforms?

Again, our engine supports huge variety of platforms, but some of them require special threatment in terms of UI and hardware resource management, so - it's possible,
but

## Who is in charge?

We are two developers with over 9 years of professional experience, very pationate about tycoons in particular and good games in common.
Also, we love stylish, beautiful things.

## How I can help?

First of all, do not hesistate to tell about Voxel Tycoon to any train-tycoon-minecraft-voxel-lover you know.

For those who want to prepare for modding the game before it will be released, we will provide some sort of early authoring tools a little bit later. Follow the news!
