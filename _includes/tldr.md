# Hey!

We are developing **Voxel Tycoon** â€” strategy game about *transportation*, *building&nbsp;factories*, and *mining* beautiful voxel landscapes.

So, if you like games such as OpenTTD and Factorio, or playng modded Minecraft, you're in the right place.

Also, it's planned to be an [extendable, community-driven platform](#mod-api) (think of Minecraft, just in a world of tycoon games).

Check out a bunch of [screenshots](#screenshots) and [gifs](#gifs).

We are going to release VT as basic gameplay features will be implemented, and then constantly update with new content and improvements.

If everything goes well, you can expect early alpha to be available *this year*.
