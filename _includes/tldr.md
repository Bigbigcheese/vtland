# Hey!

We are developing **Voxel Tycoon** â€” strategy game about *transportation*, *building&nbsp;factories*, and *mining* beautiful voxel landscapes.

So, if you like games such as OpenTTD and Factorio, or playing modded Minecraft, you're in the right place.

Please help us get on Steam by voting for VT on [Steam Greenlight](/greenlight){:.greenlight}

Also, it's planned to be an [extendable, community-driven platform](#mod-api) (think of Minecraft, just in a world of tycoon games).

Check out a bunch of [screenshots](#screenshots) and [gifs](#gifs).

We are going to release VT as basic gameplay features will be implemented, and then constantly update with new content and improvements. There Mod API and tools will be also present.

If everything goes well, you can expect early alpha to be available *this year*
