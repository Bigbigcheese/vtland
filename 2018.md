This is the second Christmas what we meet with Voxel Tycoon and you! Thank you for that!

First, some statistics: there's more than 15K lines of code in the project and more than 3K commits made to the repository. And this is just small part of planned ðŸ˜Š

Second, as you may know, at the beginning of the year we've set the rough deadline: release the game until the end of 2017. Also, Voxel Tycoon became our full-time job since August.

Game development is a tricky thing. It's full of pretty huge tasks that are hard to properly estimate. You can't imagine how much we want to let you play the game and assess the result of work that we have done during those two years.

However, our main priority is quality. The very first release can have only basic content, but it should be comfortable and fun to play. To match these standards there're few important things still need be done in the coming months.

Hope you don't mind. Believe us, we do everything we can to deliver Voxel Tycoon to you as fast as possible.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! See you in 2018 ðŸŽ„
