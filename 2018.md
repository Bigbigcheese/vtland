This is the second Christmas for Voxel Tycoon! Thank you for your support, everybody!

First off, some statistics: thereâ€™s more than 15,000 lines of code in the project, and more than 3,000 commits made to the repository. And that's just small part of what's planned! ðŸ˜Š

Second, as you may know, at the beginning of the year we set a rough deadline: release the game by the end of 2017. Also, Voxel Tycoon became our full-time job in August.

Now, game development is a tricky thing. Itâ€™s full of many, many tasks - it's hard to properly estimate how many, and how large or small they are. You canâ€™t imagine how much we want to let you play the game, and see the results of all the work we've done over these two years.

However, our main priority is quality. The very first release may only have basic content, but it still should be comfortable and fun to play. To match these standards there are a few important things that still need to be finished in the coming months.

We hope you don't mind. Believe us, we are doing everything we can to deliver Voxel Tycoon to you as fast as possible.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! See you in 2018 ðŸŽ„
