# Donate

<!-- {% include donate_btn.html %} -->

We want to be honest with you as possible, and that's the main reason why we are not accepting pre-orders — we want to make sure you'll pay for an actual game what you will love to play, not for promises.

However, we are aware that some of you want to support us either way, so we can't refuse anymore. There are few rewards to extend our special thanks for special donations.

Any person who donate at least:

<span class="money">$15</span> — will receive a *supporter* badge on [Discord](//discord.gg/64KPWd5)

<span class="money">$30</span> — will be *featured in the game credits* and receive a *supporter* badge on [Discord](//discord.gg/64KPWd5) 

Just keep in mind that **this is not a pre-order**: you will not receive a copy of the game, regardless how much you donate.

If you familiar with **Patreon**, here you go:

<a style="display: block; margin: 0 0 0 0; width: 170px; height: 39px; overflow: hidden; border: none;" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7655118">
    <img style="border-radius: 0" src="become_a_patron_button.png"/>
</a>

Otherwise, you can donate via **PayPal**:

#### Please notice: This is not a pre-order. You will not receive a copy of the game.
